## Concepts

1. Java objects model objects from a problem domain

2. Objects are created from classes. The class describes the kind of object, the objects represent individual intances of the class.

3. We can communicate with objects by invoking methods on them. Objects usually do something if we invoke a method.

4. Methods can have parameters to provide additional information for a task.

5. The method name and the parameter types of a method are called its signature. They provide the infromation needed to invoke that method.

6. Parameters have types. The type defines what kinds fo values a parameter can take.

7. Multible instances. Many similar objects can be created from a single class.

8. Objects have state. The state is represented by storing values in fields.

9. Method calling. Objects can communicate by calling each other's methods.

10. The source code of a class determines the structure and behavior (the fields and methods) of each of the objects of that class.

11. About compilation "When people write computer programs, they typically use a 'higher-level' programming language such as Java. A problem with that is that a computer cannot execute Java source code directly. Java was designed to be reasonably easy to read for humans, not for computers. Computers, internally, work with a binary representation of a machine code, which looks quite different from Java.", The Solution " is a program called the compiler".

12. The compiler translates the Java code into machine code. We can write Java and run the compiler.

13. Every time we change the source code, we must first run the compiler before we can use the class again to create an object, Othewise, the machine code version that the computer needs will not exist.

14. Result. Methods may return information about an object via a return value.

15. The word void indicates that method does not return any result.

16. objects can be passed as parameters to methods of other objects.

## Sammary:

17. Classes represent the general concept of things, while objects represent concrete instances of a class.

18. Objects have methods that we use to communicate with them. We can use a method to make a change to the object or to get information form the object. 

19. Methods can have parameters, and parameters have types, Methods have return types, which specify what type of data they return. If the return type is void, they do not return anything.

20. Objects store data in fields(which also have types). All the data values of an object together are referred to as the object's state.

21. Objects are created from class definitions.
